                  A team of students who belong to SEOUL WOMENâ€™S UNIVERSITY located in Seoul, Korea.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Students in Department of Information Security.
                </p>
                <h3>For what</h3>
                <p>
                  Our team made a system that filters harmful languages and processes them
                  into safer videos using deep learning technology to protect infants and adolescents.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This service awakens awareness of harmful languages in the video and suggests a way to solve them.
                  The goal is to process all sentences with meanings containing inappropriate expressions,
                  and the target language is limited to Korean.
